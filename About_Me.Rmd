LIke most accountancy / data types I spend most of my professional life in Excel and VBA, but I also have an interest in more modern tools.

I'm currently working on trying to get Outh2 client credentials flow working in VBA

I did my Postgraaduate work in Instrumentation, where I spectaculary failed to get thin film anemometry to work in my wind tunnel experiments.

I have a degree in Paper Science from back in the days when UMIST was still around and offering weird degrees to industrial types.
