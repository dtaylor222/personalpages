I am a support professional with a wide-ranging experience and expertise in several areas of tech.

Untill recently my specialism was Crystal reports (produced for an accounting software firm) Prior to this I used many other platfoms and tools (Mostly Linux)

Initially a developer, I found direct customer contact more rewarding.

I maintain an interest in modern tools like 'R' and often attend tech meetups to keep up to speed.

I'm currently working on trying to get OAuth2 client credentials flow working in VBA, as its widely used in the domain I'm targeting and I used to do my instrumentation coding and data capture in Excel many years ago.

I did my Postgraduate work in Instrumentation, but havent touched an oscilloscope in over a decade.

I have a degree in Paper Science from back in the days when UMIST offered  specialised industry-focussed courses.
