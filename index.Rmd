This is my personal website created using RStudio.

Initially it will host my [CV](CV.html) as rendered from markdown.

I'll also be adding other things as they occur to me.
Such as my very small 'R' example for a [linearmodel](linearmodel.html) with some noise

I am Currently open to employment opportunities.
