This is my personal website created using RStudio and GitHub

Initially it will host my [CV](CV.html) as rendered from markdown.

You can find a (very) brief bio [here](About_Me.html)

I am currently open to employment opportunities.
[Contact details](Contact_Me.html)

I'll also be adding other things as they occur to me.
Such as my very small 'R' example for a [linearmodel](linearmodel.html) with some noise
